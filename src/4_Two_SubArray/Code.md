## Two subarrays

### Description

Given a string S of size N having all lowercase characters. Count all the substrings of S such that in each substring no character occurs more than twice.

## Input

First line: Single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case:
First line: Single integer denoting the value of N.
Next line contains the string S.
Constraints:
1 <= T<= 10
1<= N <= 100000

## Output

For each test case, print in a new line a single integer denoting the number of substrings.

- Sample Input 1

```
1
5
aabba
```

- Sample Output 1

```
14
```

- Hint

Given for the only test case,
N = 5
S : "aabba"

Only the substring "aabba" of S has occurrences character 'a' 3 times which is greater than 2. Rest all substrings have all its constituent characters not more than twice. Hence the answer is 14.
